  - various Regex scripts for getting player names, team names, etc. from sentences
- ### old
  - old scripts used for easy references
- ### pbp_custom_ners
  - custom Spacy NER (named entity recognition) models for extracting player types (entities) from Play-By-Play sentences
  - EXAMPLE:
    - Sentence -> Aaron Rodgers pass complete right to Davante Adams for 11 yards (tackle by Harrison Smith)
    - Entities -> PASSER: Aaron Rodgers, RECEIVER: Davante Adams, TACKLER: Harrison Smith
  - train.py
    - used to create training data for custom Spacy NER model from user input
    - GUI used to display desired Play-By-Play lines, corresponding names found in each line, and dropdown inputs for each name to choose entity type (PASSER, RUSHER, etc.)
  - models.ipynb -> trains and saves Spacy model
  - test_models.ipynb -> test Spacy model using Displacy to view entities for a given sentence
  - custom_ents.py -> loads custom Spacy model + methods to extract entities from a sentence
  - data -> contains train.json
  - models -> contains Spacy models-last, models-best (USED), and train.spacy
- ### pbp_names
  - custom_names_model.ipynb
    - uses Space "en_core_web_sm" model and adds custom train data to get player names (entity type = PERSON) from a sentence
    - EXAMPLE:
      - Sentence -> Thomas Morstead kicks off 68 yards, returned by Randall Cobb for 27 yards (tackle by Leigh Torrence)
      - Entities -> (0, 15, "PERSON") {Thomas Morstead}, (48, 60, "PERSON") {Randall Cobb}, (85, 99, "PERSON") {Leigh Torrence}
  - custom_names.py
    - load model from directory
    - get_name_custom -> ARGS: sentence <=> RETURN: all unique names joined by "|"
    - get_name_indices -> ARGS: sentence, name <=> RETURN: list of all start and end indices for the given name
  - main.py (IN PROGRESS/UNUSED) -> test model accuracy using sentences from allDetails.txt

    - conversion.py
      - convert joined Pandas DataFrame row to new play_info DataFrame 
    - penalties.py
